The model files are too large to be uploaded to Github. Hence we uploaded it to OneDrive.
You can download it from the link https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am9Mk04MA_K1bJK7Kqt16UdiLu0?e=t90cnc. 
The folder named models contains three folders which are googlenet, resnet50 and resnet50_pruning. 
These are the corresponding model files of each network. 
param.bin, data.bin, fc1000.bin and other feature map binary files of middle layers are included in each network folder. 
param.bin and data.bin can be used with quantization files as model inputs. 
fc1000.bin and other feature map binary files can be used as inference verification files which needs to be refered by the verify() function in the cnn/host/src/network_helper.cpp.
